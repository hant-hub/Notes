People do not realize that they are asking
about the state of a Black Body.
White Americans have deified the idea of 
democracy. They praise the concept of democracy
so much they ignore the ways they violate
their own values.
The values Americans show in their actions show
their true values. When they say all men are equal,
they have a hidden definition of men.

Americans see race as a feature of reality. Race
does not create racism, rather race is the product
of suppression. And white people are just as much a
product of racism as the Black. What separates Blackness
from Whiteness is the fact that Whiteness is defined
by its power over the non-White. Whiteness flattens
a diversity of groups into, "the people in power".

Police as a body wield the power to destory and kill
as permitted by the state. The policing of racial
minorities is how White society exerts its power.
Nothing particularly evil in the perpetrators. They
are reflecting the expectations and history of the
systems they reside within.
