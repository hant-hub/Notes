\newpage

Over the course we have touched on many different ways
race and policing intersect. My current understanding of
these concepts places them within a context that is much
larger and more complicated than any single individual or
group.

Race as a concept and ideology has been deconstructed
during this course, as a social layer on top of the physical
reality. Race is not tied to biology or history or appearance
so much as it is a social othering, the relegation of some to
the bottom of society. Personally I understand the cause of 
this to not be any single person or group hating another, but
of many groups and people taking advantage of previous
othering.

When colonizing Africa the rhetoric of civilizing and savagery
worked well in convincing people to visit upon others horrific
crimes. When someone needs cheap labor it is easy to piggy back
off of the previous rhetoric to build an idea of a lazy
African who can only be civilized through hard labor. When trying
to win the votes of the Irish it was useful to align yourself
with them, and against the lazy savage Blacks. In that way I
see race as the product of many cruel, apathetic decisions.
Each step was wrong but each action made the following ones
easier until Race and racial identity was a bedrock upon which
so much stood. 

In this framing the role of police is that of control. It is the
means by which the rhetorical framework of Race is replicated.
Black people must be criminal, so over policing and targeted
laws ensure Black people fill up prisons. Black people are
lazy and poor, so regulations like redlining and sharecropping
exist which all but garuntee it. And the role of police in
all these systems is to be the physical violence which makes
the lines solid and meaningful.

I think that these things are all good and important to learn,
but they aren't really new to me personally. The things which
have left the deepest impression on me is the fear Coates had
when he spoke of being a Black boy in America, the way
race becomes the governing force for real people. It is not
precise nor is it an explanation of any kind. But it has something
which I cannot help but value as much as the more technical
explanations, it has a real human perspective.

The tragedy of Race isn't the particulars of its functioning
but in the suffering and objectification it visits upon everyone
who participates. 

It is that kind of a perspective my first testimonial attempted
to give. I am not a Black man and I have never been treated as
anything other than White. However White people do not benefit
from the existence of Race, they are made into tools, and 
separated from some of the best, kindest, most interesting, and
beautiful people in the world. I still believe in
what I said in the first testimonial. Policing is a corrupting
force for the White men who do it, they are convinced that the
harm done to others is good, and then they are recruited to
participate in that harm. This is a view and perspective which
is perfectly consistent with my understanding of Race and policing
in a more abstract sense. White people may hate minorities but
that isn't because of something innate to White people. Systems
which were shaped by the decisions of thousands guide them down
old paths. 

That is the experience of police I wanted to share, that of seeing
kids you know grow up and become cruel, become the tools
of the cruel and apathetic. I think that in light of what I
know this story is the one I should share. I am not a scholar
with new ideas, nor am I a marginalized voice with direct
uncomfortable experiences with policing. And to those with
both the experience of being on the other side of the law,
or with far greater historical knowledge of these systems
I only want to offer my own human perspective.
