            Monakea Protectors on Campus. Monakea is the
            tallest mountain in Hawaii and is a sacred
            site for the indigenous Hawaiians.

            Monakea has been used by the US to build
            astronomic observatories.

            Currently protesting building of 30m telescope
            funded by UCSC. Its a large desecration,
            and a waste of money considering the budget
            cuts elsewhere.


            Friday, at Quarry, free food, orientation.
            6-8pm, Muwekma Ohlone.
