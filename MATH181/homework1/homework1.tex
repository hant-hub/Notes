\newpage


I don't have a particularly interesting background in mathematics.
I am primarily a Computer Science Major and has taken, Calculus 1, 2
and Vector. I have also some experience in Linear Algebra, Discrete Math,
and Statistics. I have a personal interest in geometry as pertaining to
simulation and physics as well as a great interest in numerical integration.
I have always been a lover of math even if I am not motivated to solely study
math. This class seemed an excellent way to learn both about unique mathematics
as well as history and context. In the past I took a class about analyzing
contemporary issues through a historical lens, this class seemed to me like
a similar class that is more relevant to my specialization.

One topic I would like to learn about is when did mathematics split from natural
philosophy and physics, if it ever did. I recently have been learning about some of
the debates that happened when Physics seperated from philosophy and I am curious
about what if any debates happened when logic became a thing of mathematics rather
than purely philosophy.
