{\large Abstract}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Retrospective on the 2014 effort for a formal
        proof of the Kepler conjecture
\end{itemize}

{\large Intro}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Origins in atomic theory and packing of cannonballs
    \item Kepler made the conjecture in his essay
        On The Six Cornered Snowflake
    \item Hilbert added it to his list of problems at the
        International Congress in Paris 1900
    \item Proved by Hales and Sam Ferguson in 1998,
        however ended up stuck in review for 8 years
        \begin{mdframed}
            Based on a method proposed by
            L\'aszl\'o Fejes T\'oth in 1953
        \end{mdframed}
    \item Formal efforts started by Hales to attempt and
        get ahead of the work to standardize computer
        assistance in proofs.
\end{itemize}
