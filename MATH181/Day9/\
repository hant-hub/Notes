    \item What are the Origins of Greek Theoretical Math? 
        \begin{mdframed}
            Famous Euclidian quote about the purity
            of learning mathematics for the purpose of
            knowledge. Greek mathematics was very unconcerned
            with application and focused on abstract
            gains in knowledge.

            \begin{itemize}
                \item Katz textbook has a confident guess
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item From Thales (624-547 BC)
                            and Pythagoras (572-497 BC)
                        \item Brough from Egypt
                        \item Pythagoras was a mystic/religious
                            leader who preached "all is numbers"
                    \end{itemize}
                \item Pros:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item primary sources say it
                    \end{itemize}
                \item Cons:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item  sources are very late, hundreds
                            of years later and had clear 
                            agendas.
                        \item No mathematical sources before
                            400 BC, nothing from Pythagoras'
                            followers
                    \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
