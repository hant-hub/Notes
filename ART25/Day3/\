    \item {\large Society of the Spectacle}  
        \begin{mdframed}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Games are considered to be separate from
                    life, that is an illusion.\\
                    Games are a part of life, and their ability
                    to impact us is only possible because
                    the relationship goes two ways.
                \item Wartime propaganda
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item He is talking about SS soldiers
                            being depicted as a evil baboon,
                            I think it is actually supposed to
                            be a Japanese soldier.
                        \item I think he mixed up the anti-Nazi
                            and ant-Japanese propaganda.
                    \end{itemize}
                \item Post War Propaganda
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Family Unit
                        \item Christianity
                        \item Whiteness
                        \item Informationals, the way society is,
                            is how society was, and how society
                            will be. Society is formulaic.
                    \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
