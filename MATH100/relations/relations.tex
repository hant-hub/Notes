            Schr\"oder-Bernstein Theorem. 

            Given two infinite sets, A and B.
            If $|A| \le |B|$ and $|B| \ge |A|$, does
            its mean $|A| = |B|$. In other words,
            if we have an injection from A to B
            and an injection from B to A, must there
            be a bijection?

            The answer is yes, however it is non-trivial. Schr\"oder-Bernstein
            says the answer is yes, so when proving the equality of cardinality,
            we only need to exhibit injections in both directions rather
            than a bijection.


            Cool Proof look up later.
